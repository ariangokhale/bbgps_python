# bluebike-routing-app

### Application that allows a user to route from one Bluebike station to one close to their destination. Built with Python (Flask back-end) and JavaScript/HTML/CSS (Jinja2 front-end).

### The station data is based on the csv file retrieved from https://www.bluebikes.com/system-data (station location data). 

### Use Case
#### For example, if starting from Boston Common BlueBike station and the destination is Harvard University, what is the closest station to Harvard a user can dock their bike? This application displays the location and the directions/routing to get the station via GoogleMaps API.
